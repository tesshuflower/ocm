# OCM Downstream/Upstream Sync Guide

## Repository Relationship

This repo (`stolostron/ocm`) is a **downstream fork** of the upstream community project
[`open-cluster-management-io/ocm`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm).

The upstream repo is cloned separately on disk (typically at `~/Desktop/upstream_ocm`).
The downstream adds Red Hat / ACM-specific files and features on top of the shared upstream codebase.

| Attribute | Downstream (this repo) | Upstream |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| GitHub | `stolostron/ocm` | `open-cluster-management-io/ocm` |
| Git remote name | `origin` | `upstream` |
| Branch | `main` | `main` |

## Downstream-Only Files

These files exist ONLY in the downstream fork and must be preserved during syncs:

- **`.tekton/`** -- Tekton pipeline configs for Konflux CI (MCE component builds)
- **`renovate.json`** -- Renovate bot config extending stolostron/acm-config
- **`sonar-project.properties`** -- SonarQube code analysis config
- **`TRIGGER_BUILD`** -- Build trigger timestamp file
- **`OWNERS`** -- May have additional temporary approvers compared to upstream

## Downstream-Only Commits

The downstream fork contains commits that will never exist in upstream:

- **ACM-\* prefixed commits** -- Red Hat ACM bug fixes and features
- **Tekton file additions** -- `.tekton/` pipeline YAML files for Konflux
- **Konflux/RHTAP commits** -- Red Hat CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Renovate config changes** -- Downstream-specific dependency management

## Historical Sync Patterns

Two methods have been used to sync:

### 1. GitHub "Sync Fork" Button (Bulk Merge)
Creates commits like `Merge branch 'open-cluster-management-io:main' into main`. Brings in
all upstream commits since the last sync as a single merge commit. This is the primary method.

### 2. Manual Cherry-Pick Sync PRs (Targeted)
When a specific upstream PR is urgently needed before the next bulk sync, someone creates a
branch like `sync-upstream-pr-NNNN` that cherry-picks or recreates the upstream commit.
This creates **different SHAs** for the same content, which can cause merge conflicts later.

## How to Sync (Step-by-Step)

### Prerequisites

Ensure the `upstream` remote is configured. It can point to a local clone of upstream or
directly to the GitHub URL:

```bash
# Option A: point to a local clone
git remote add upstream /path/to/upstream_ocm

# Option B: point to GitHub directly
git remote add upstream git@github.com:open-cluster-management-io/ocm.git
```

### Step 1: Fetch upstream

```bash
git fetch upstream main
```

### Step 2: Create a sync branch

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b sync-upstream-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Step 3: Merge upstream

```bash
git merge upstream/main --no-ff
```

Using `--no-ff` ensures a merge commit is created, which makes the sync point visible in
history. Individual upstream commits are preserved with their original SHAs.

### Step 4: Resolve conflicts

Conflicts typically appear in **go.mod**, **go.sum**, and **vendor/modules.txt** due to
dependency version differences from manual cherry-pick syncs or independent bumps.

Resolution strategy:
- For dependencies that exist in both repos: **take upstream's version** (source of truth)
- For downstream-only dependencies (rare): keep them
- Downstream-only files (`.tekton/`, `renovate.json`, etc.) should never conflict

To resolve conflicts manually:
1. Open each conflicted file and find `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers
2. For each conflict, keep the `upstream/main` version (between `=======` and `>>>>>>>`)
3. Delete the conflict markers and the `HEAD` version
4. Stage resolved files: `git add go.mod go.sum vendor/modules.txt`

For bulk resolution of go.sum conflicts (takes upstream's version for all):

```bash
python3 -c "
with open('go.sum', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.read().split('\n')
result, skip = [], False
for line in lines:
    if line.startswith('<<<<<<< HEAD'): skip = True; continue
    elif line.startswith('=======') and skip: skip = False; continue
    elif line.startswith('>>>>>>> upstream/'): continue
    elif not skip: result.append(line)
with open('go.sum', 'w') as f:
    f.write('\n'.join(result))
"
```

### Step 5: Update downstream-only Dockerfiles

If the upstream sync includes a **Go version bump** (check `go.mod` for a changed `go` directive),
the RHTAP Dockerfiles must be updated manually — they are downstream-only and won't be touched by
the merge.

```bash
# Check current Go version in go.mod
head -5 go.mod

# Check current version in RHTAP Dockerfiles
grep "golang-builder" build/Dockerfile.*.rhtap
```

Update all five RHTAP Dockerfiles to match (e.g. `rhel_9_1.25` -> `rhel_9_1.26`):

```
build/Dockerfile.addon.rhtap
build/Dockerfile.placement.rhtap
build/Dockerfile.registration.rhtap
build/Dockerfile.registration-operator.rhtap
build/Dockerfile.work.rhtap
```

The builder image tag pattern is `rhel_9_<goversion>`, e.g.:

```
FROM brew.registry.redhat.io/rh-osbs/openshift-golang-builder:rhel_9_1.26 AS builder
```

Note: the runtime base image (`ubi9/ubi-minimal`) and Red Hat `LABEL` blocks in the RHTAP
Dockerfiles are intentionally different from the upstream Dockerfiles (`ubi9/ubi-micro`, no
labels) and should **not** be changed to match upstream.

Commit the Dockerfile changes separately:

```bash
git add build/Dockerfile.*.rhtap
git commit -m "chore: upgrade RHTAP Dockerfiles to Go <version>"
```

### Step 6: Verify downstream-only files

After resolving conflicts, verify these files still exist and are unchanged:

```bash
ls .tekton/
cat renovate.json
cat sonar-project.properties
cat TRIGGER_BUILD
cat OWNERS
```

### Step 7: Commit and push

```bash
git commit -m "Sync with upstream open-cluster-management-io/ocm $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push origin sync-upstream-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

Then create a PR on GitHub targeting `main`.

**Important:** When merging the PR, always use **"Create a merge commit"** — not squash or
rebase. This preserves the original upstream commit SHAs in the downstream history, making
future syncs and divergence checks accurate.

## Handling Manual/Urgent Cherry-Picks

If a specific upstream PR is needed before the next bulk sync:

1. Identify the upstream PR number and commit SHA
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b sync-upstream-pr-NNNN`
3. Cherry-pick: `git cherry-pick <upstream-sha>`
4. PR title convention: `:seedling: [sync] <original commit message>`
5. PR body should reference: `Synced from upstream PR: open-cluster-management-io#NNNN`

**Warning:** Cherry-picks create different SHAs. The next bulk sync merge will likely have
conflicts in go.mod/go.sum where both versions appear. Resolve by taking upstream's version.

## Diagnosing Sync State

To check how far behind downstream is from upstream:

```bash
# Fetch latest upstream
git fetch upstream main

# See commits in upstream that aren't in downstream
git log --oneline upstream/main --not origin/main

# See downstream-only commits
git log --oneline origin/main --not upstream/main
```
